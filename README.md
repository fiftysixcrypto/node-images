## Installing Docker

Before running any blockchain nodes, you'll need to have Docker installed on your system. We provide step-by-step guides for installing Docker on various operating systems:

- [Ubuntu](./docs/installing-docker-ubuntu.md)
- [macOS](./docs/installing-docker-macos.md)
- [Windows](./docs/installing-docker-windows.md)

## Using Docker

Our repository offers Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files specifically tailored for each blockchain. These files simplify the process of deploying nodes, allowing you to start and manage blockchain nodes with ease.

- [Bitcoin Dockerfiles and Compose files](./docs/bitcoin.md)
- [Ethereum Dockerfiles and Compose files](./docs/ethereum.md)
- [Litecoin Dockerfiles and Compose files](./docs/litecoin.md)
- [Dogecoin Dockerfiles and Compose files](./docs/dogecoin.md)

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the links above to install Docker on your system, review the blockchain-specific requirements, and select the appropriate Dockerfiles and Compose files for the blockchain nodes you wish to run.
