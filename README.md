## Installing Docker and Docker Compose

In order to run Fiftysix blockchain node images, Docker and Docker Compose is required. Below is a guide on how to install both on different operating systems.

### Ubuntu (22.04) -- Installing Docker and Docker Compose

1. **Update Your Package Index**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   To ensure that your APT works with HTTPS:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```

3. **Add Dockerâ€™s Official GPG Key**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

5. **Add the Docker Repository**
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```

6. **Update Your Package Index** (again after adding new repository)
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

7. **Install Docker CE (Community Edition)**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-ce
   ```

8. **Verify Installation**
   Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the Hello World image.
   ```bash
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

9. **Manage Docker as a Non-root User** (Optional but recommended)
   If you want to run Docker commands without `sudo`, you need to add your user to the Docker group.
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
   su - ${USER}
   ```
   You will need to log out and back in for this to take effect.

#### Installing Docker Compose

As of Docker Compose version 1.27.0, you can use the Docker CLI plugin.

1. **Download the Latest Version of Docker Compose**
   First, check the current release and replace `<version>` with the version of Compose you want to use (for example, v2.27.0). Latest versions can be found here: [Docker Compose Releases](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).
   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/<version>/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

2. **Set Permissions**
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   Check if Docker Compose is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

## Running a Compose File

In order to run a specific compose file, navigate to the directory and run the following command:

```
ln -s <compose-file> docker-compose.yml
```

Then run (you may need to preface this command with `sudo`):

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Logs can be tracked directly by running:

```
docker logs <container-name>
```

## Bitcoin

### Bitcoin Core

"Bitcoin Core connects to the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to download and fully validate blocks and transactions." - [Bitcoin Core Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)

#### JSON-RPC

Using the base compose file, one can interact with Bitcoin Core using the following request:

```
curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "getblockcount", "params": []}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
```

More documentation can be found on the official [Bitcoin Core Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md).

Further information can be found on the official [Bitcoin website](http://bitcoin.org/).

### ord

`ord` is the software for Ordinals, "...an open-source project, developed on GitHub. The project consists of a BIP describing the ordinal scheme, an index that communicates with a Bitcoin Core node to track the location of all satoshis, a wallet that allows making ordinal-aware transactions, a block explorer for interactive exploration of the blockchain, functionality for inscribing satoshis with digital artifacts, and this manual." - [Ordinals Documentation](https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html)

#### Server

Using the base compose file, `ord` will open a local web server on `http://localhost:80`. Once fully synced, you can view latest inscriptions here and make requests to the JSON-API below.

#### JSON-API

Using the base compose file, one can interact with `ord` using the following request:

```
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" 'http://0.0.0.0:80/inscriptions'
```

More documentation can be found on the official [Ordinals website](https://docs.ordinals.com/guides/explorer.html#json-api).

## Litecoin

### Litecoin Core

"Litecoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Litecoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Litecoin Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency." - [Litecoin Core Github](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin)

#### JSON-RPC

Using the base compose file, one can interact with Litecoin Core using the following request (note the required user/pass, as specified in the Litecoin compose files):

```
curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "getblockcount", "params": []}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:9332/
```

More documentation can be found on the official [Litecoin Core Github](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin).

Further information can be found on the official [Litecoin website](https://litecoin.org/).

### ord-litecoin

`ord` is the software for Ordinals, just like Bitcoin, except on Litecoin. `ord-litecoin` is forked from the official `ord` repository, and can be found [here](https://github.com/ynohtna92/ord-litecoin).

"...an open-source project, developed on GitHub. The project consists of a BIP describing the ordinal scheme, an index that communicates with a Bitcoin Core node to track the location of all satoshis, a wallet that allows making ordinal-aware transactions, a block explorer for interactive exploration of the blockchain, functionality for inscribing satoshis with digital artifacts, and this manual." - [Ordinals Documentation](https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html)

## Ethereum

There are multiple networks Ethereum can sync, including:
- Ethereum mainnet
- Goerli
- Sepolia
- Holesky
- (custom network/network id)

There are also numerous ways one can sync the Ethereum blockchain's state (execution clients), in modes such as:
- snap
- full
- archive
- light (currently unavailable with `geth`)

More information on the different sync modes can be found on the [geth documentation website](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/sync-modes).

**The default Fiftysix Ethereum sync is for Ethereum mainnet, in snap sync mode. This gets the user an up-and-running Ethereum node in the quickest manner possible. For other configurations, review the compose files in the `/ethereum` directory.**

### Execution Clients

There are multiple clients that can be used to track Ethereum state. More information on the clients can be found on the [Ethereum official documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients).
